# Connect-With-Friends

Connect With Friends is a P2P-schemed Connect Four game made with Socket.io and Angular. Using Socket.io, a NodeJS server hosted on Heroku acts as a broker between two players (read: friends). 

There are a lot of bugs that I have not tracked down yet, so if you come across any please let me know!
